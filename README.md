# data-512-homework_2
This repo holds the homework assignment 2 in the DATA 512: Human Centered Data Science Course.

## Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles on political figures from different countries. For this assignment, it is required to combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article.

It is then needed to perform an analysis of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies among countries. The analysis will consist of a series of tables that show:
1.	The countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.
2.	The countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.
3.	A ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.
